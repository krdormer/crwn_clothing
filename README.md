CRWN-Clothing E-Commerce Web Application

This is a React app for the company 'CRWN-Clothing'. It is styled with SASS,
has its state managed with Redux, and user sign in and sign up is handled by
Google Firebase authentication. Google Firestore is also used to serve some 
of the app content. Stripe payments have been integrated with a dummy card, 
& was integrated to demonstatrate that functionality which could quickly be
expanded into accepting actual payments. CRWN-Clothing is hosted as a live 
demo on Heroku.
